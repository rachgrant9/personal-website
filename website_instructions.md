Create a portfolio website, highlighting my CV and linking to my GitHub & LinkedIn Profiles.

- The web site should be simple, clean and have a stylish UI interface.
- Tech stack: Astro, Tailwind CSS, Vercel
- Create a placeholder config file where I can add links to my other sites e.g. GitHUb and LinkedIn
- Create a placeholder CV txt file that is parsed to generate the portfolio contents
- Create GitHub Actions to deploy the application
- The website must be a clean single page application, with the following sections:
* Introduction
* Experience
* Links
* Contact
- Include instructions for setting up hosting in vercel if you need human input for this.
